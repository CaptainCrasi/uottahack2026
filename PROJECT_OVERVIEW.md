# Project Overview

## Core Mission
This web application allows **Small Businesses** to identify and connect with their exact target audience. By leveraging **Yellowcake** to scan Reddit, the platform finds users matching specific interest criteria based on real-world conversations and needs.

## Key Features

### 1. Audience Discovery (Guest & Public)
- **Reddit Scanning**: Uses **Yellowcake** technology to scan Reddit comments and posts.
- **Matchmaking**: Users describe their project/product, and the system lists Reddit users who fit the target audience profile based on their online activity.
- **Connection**: Provides a pathway to connect with these potential leads externally.

### 2. Market Gap Discovery Tool (✨ WOW Feature)
- **Identify Opportunities**: A specialized tool that analyzes aggregate data to find "gaps in the market"—unmet needs and frustrations expressed by users online.
- **Data-Driven Brainstorming**: Instead of random ideas, this tool uses the scanned Reddit data ("what people say they need") to suggest high-potential business opportunities or pivots that solve real, existing problems.

### 3. Logged-In Experience
- **Business Profile**: Users can create a detailed profile explaining their business idea or product.
- **Challenge Definition**: Users can explicitly state their main challenges regarding their target audience.
- **AI Assistance**: An integrated AI helper aids users in writing and refining their business descriptions and challenge statements to ensure the "Yellowcake" scanner works optimally.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Vite (Green themes, professional aesthetics)
